Hey you awesome people, I hope your Thanksgiving breaks were filled with dead birds, smallpox blankets, family, and the ghosts of the Native Americans who were murdered by the Pilgrims. My break was spent watching the Star Wars marathon on SpikeTV and taking hits of eggnog straight to the vein; I never felt more alive, that sugar rush babyyyYEAAHHH!!! 

Ok, here we go, announcements, are you ready?

The prototype arm is DONE!!! By "done" I mean the actuators are attached, it's capable of movement, and I don't feel like working on it until after break. I've included a picture of it proudly raising a makeshift UW flag in the non-existent breeze. If you're part of the control systems team, this little buddy is going to be your bread and butter for the next few months, be gentle. 

Machine shop certified strike team, I'll be in the lab on Thursday and Friday from 12:30pm-5:00pm and 2:00pm-5:00pm respectively. If you can make it, we will be machining more parts for our kickass chassis that will disturb the shit out of the sand in Utah. 

We'll be having our final Autumn quarter meeting this Friday at the same old time (5:00pm) in our same old place (MEB 238). I'm planning to focus on the hand and scientific station because we are going to start production on those once we snuggle into Winter quarter. I know it's dead-week and all, so I will again provide exemplary refreshments and libations in celebration of our first quarter achievements.

That's no moon,

Christian
