Greetings Space Cadets,

Good news everyone, I have announcements!

1. I just ate a burrito
2. There are <strong>4-5 open spots for machine shop certification</strong> on 11/14 and 11/15, at 9:30am to 11:30am and 1:30pm to 3:30pm respectively. These spots are from people who have previously signed up, but can't make it. Make their terrible loss your gain!!! We are in touch with the Machine Shop GrandMaster, so if you are interested in skipping your important classes that you are paying too much money for so you can learn a real world skill, email me soon for further details. Machining Skill +5 GET!!! (Note: If you get machine shop certified, you will become a very busy person with lots of important busy things to do)
3. hey, hey science station people, yeah, yeah you, one of our glorious control systems leads, Collin, came across this article about the new [raspberry pi IR camera][cam] that he no doubt "found" during a "long" marathon of "internet" "browsing". It may or may not interest you, but it wouldn't hurt taking a peak at it. 
4. I know it's on everybody's mind and it's not the inside surface of your skull. It's the fact that, right now in the whole scheme of things, stuff it kind off boring. I'm sorry, we can't all be as fun as communications majors (SHOTS FIRED!!!). I promise things will get really lively once we get more funding (we are trying real hard to squeeze cash from those who have too much, atop their corporate ladders) and have machine certified people. 
5. I have a feeling we won't be having a general meeting tomorrow. There's not much to announce. But, of course, we will be having our spectacular Friday meeting extravaganza.
6. If you no longer want my heartfelt emails, just tell/email me. I won't be angry, only hurt.

tl;dr: Machine shop spots, science, burrito, meeting stuff, lol comm majors, don't talk about fight club

Holler back y'all,

Christian Carpio
