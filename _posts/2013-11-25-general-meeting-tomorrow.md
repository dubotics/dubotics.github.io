Hello everyone!

In light of Thanksgiving coming this Thursday, our meeting is **tomorrow, _NOT_ Thursday**. 
We hope you enjoy your thanksgiving however you choose to spend it, and for those of you who 
partake in Black Friday, may your endeavors find you many deals!

Because of the schedule change, our meeting will be in a new location. **Tomorrow's meeting will be 
held at the Mechanical Engineering Building Room #238 - _NOT Smith Hall_**. The meeting will be 
held at the usual time of 5:00 PM.

See you all there!
