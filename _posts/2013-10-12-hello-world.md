### About

This is an example of a blog post. It was posted under the 
"general" category, which can be used for arbitrary club-wide
announcements or posts.

<!--excerpt-->

### Excerpts

While I was editing the post, I deliberately marked out the 
first paragraph to serve as an excerpt for this post. If you
look at this blog post from any of the "archive" pages 
(the blog or the category archives), you'll notice that 
only that paragraph is displayed.

### Authorship

The site is deliberately kept simple, so we don't really have
users of any kind -- the author can be whoever or whatever
you want it to be.
