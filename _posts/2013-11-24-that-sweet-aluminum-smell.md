    I'll be in the machine shop tomorrow (11/25) from 1:30pm~ to 8pm, and on Tuesday from 4:45pm~ to 
    8:00pm. We will be machining parts for both the chassis and arm. If you're machine shop 
    certified, I highly encourage you to come if you can, we have LOTS of parts to make. If you're 
    not certified, I may or may not have something for you to do. But if you're just absolutely 
    flowing with robotic pleasure juices and need a quick fix, I'll find something for you to do, 
    or you could take pictures for our upcoming website release super bonanza, cause we need those.

Good morrow,

I thought I write out a quick email while watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force and eating spoon fulls 
of peanut butter. We're finally getting busy and everything is going awesome! Last year, we were 
at this point in April, so we got that going for us. 

If you haven't seen them already, we got our shipment of 3 15rpm 500oz-in gear motors, a 
180lb 10"-stroke linear actuator, and the necessary mounts for those.

The other officers and I are meeting with the chair of EE on Tuesday at 4:00pm to beg for cash 
and faculty support. 

I'll be in the machine shop tomorrow (11/25) from 1:30pm~ to 8pm, and on Tuesday from 4:45pm~ to

I highly encourage you to come if you can, we have LOTS of parts to make. If you're not certified, 
I may or may not have something for you to do. But if you're just absolutely flowing with robotic 
pleasure juices and need a quick fix, I'll find something for you to do, or you could take pictures

We have no Friday meeting this week because of BirdDay.

Keep on keepin' on you awesome star people
