Hello everyone,

I hope you all have been having a great time at school! Details of our first general meeting have now come in and we hope you all will be available for it!

The meeting will be held at Smith 120 at 5:00 PM on Thursday (10/10/13). If you are not familiar with Smith hall, it is the South-Eastern building of the quad and room 120 is an auditorium. There is no need to RSVP ahead of time for the event, feel free to show up and bring anyone along you think would be interested - the room seats 265 people so there is no shortage of space.

Thanks again for your guys' interest and we hope to see you all there!
