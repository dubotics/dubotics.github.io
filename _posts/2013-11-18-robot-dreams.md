hi

Ok, now that we have the pleasantries out of the way, let's talk about stuff. 

The first epic build session will be tomorrow (11/19) from 4pm~ to whenever the machine shop closes or whenever we feel like we hit a good stopping point. The arm isn't terribly hard to make, so it should be overwhelming. We can also work on the hand if we have time. Anyone can come and help, especially if you're machine shop certified. 

I have pushed back the 2nd build session from Thursday to Friday starting at 1:30pm. We are getting our actuators delivered sometime on Thursday and would like time to measure, examine, and probe them before we start sticking them places. It would be unwise to machine a bunch of stuff based on their specs online only to find out things don't fit. The normal meeting on Friday will still happen.

We have a Saturday work/machine day too, but this one is centered more around the chassis. The more the merrier, within reason of course, don't bring your family, extended family, or that homeless man you gave change to. This will start at 10:00am and end whenever.

We need pictures! We are still looking for a DUBotics Official Photographer Extraordinaire. If you have a nice DSLR camera or know a self-entitled art student who will scoff at you for asking them to help, we need some good ol'fashion point and click! We're planning to debut our shiny new website to the world soon and need to fill it up with your beautiful smiles.

yep,

Christian
