Hello everyone!

Just here to remind you all that tomorrow (or today if you are actually getting some sleep and do not happen to read this e-mail until morning), Thursday, November 14, is the date of our next bi-weekly meeting. It will be at the same place, Smith 120, at the same time, 5 P.M.

We will be giving updates on the URC subsystem teams, information on workshop fundraising efforts, and information/plans for the Robotics Anonymous section of our organization.

Hope to see you all there!
