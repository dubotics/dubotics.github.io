    Today's agenda is as follows:  we'll do a quick review of the system architecture as we'll be 
    using for testing in upcoming weeks, before the folks who have volunteered to work on drive 
    control, arm control, and base-station code each give us a short report on what they've 
    accomplished, what needs to be done, and how we can help.  After that, we'll break into smaller 
    groups and do what needs to be done.

It's that time of the week again!

...No, er, I mean well yes, it is Saturday, and I suppose there might be a certain televised sports 
event that American culture mandates we watch with our buddies while drinking copious amounts of 
alcohol and shouting at our television screens (because that makes so much sense and is obviously 
going to help our chosen team win or something).

But lucky for you I don't really get this whole "sports" thing.  So I thought it would be nice if we 
built robots instead!  That's even better, right?  Right? (Just nod your head. ;)

So.  Silly posturing aside, here's where we stand: it would be very very nice to have code ready for 
drive testing by this coming Tuesday, and I think that this is actually a realistic goal for us.  
I've uploaded to GitHub some of the high-level communication and input code I've been working on 
since April; aside from that, we just need to write some of the glue that moves those values from 
the network to the I2C bus, and from the I2C bus to the actuators.

Today's agenda is as follows:  we'll do a quick review of the system architecture as we'll be using 
for testing in upcoming weeks, before the folks who have volunteered to work on drive control, arm 
control, and base-station code each give us a short report on what they've accomplished, what needs 
to be done, and how we can help.  After that, we'll break into smaller groups and do what needs to 
be done.

Oh, and there's some interesting goings-on with the code for Pieces of Eight, the robot that 
Robotics Anonymous lead Tyler Williams wants to refurbish; I'll bring that up at some point.

As usual, we're meeting at **3 pm** in **MEB 238**.  Today's meeting will likely extend to around 
4:30 pm.

I'll see you all there!
