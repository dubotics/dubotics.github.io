Hello everyone!

Hope everyone's been doing alright with midterm season passing through. This is a friendly reminder that tomorrow's meeting (October 17) will once again be in **Smith Hall's Auditorium 120 at 5:00 PM**. Feel free to show up and get more information about the different projects we have to offer and the groups you could be a part of.

For those of you who missed the previous meeting due to conflict - yes, you are still eligible to be a member of DUBotics! We do not expect any one of you to forgo going to class or a midterm to attend a meeting; so, rest assured that missing the first meeting did not affect your membership.

**Last meeting**, we went over the different groups you can join and laid out the road map for this coming year's activities.

To sum up the meeting, **there are a lot of opportunities for anybody of any _skill level_ to get involved with robotics within DUBotics**. We are offering three main forums of activities: Workshops, Robotics Anonymous, and our Competition Team.

-   **Workshops**: For those of you without or who possess a limited skill set in robotics, we recommend our workshops to teach you the basic disciplines of robotics. 
-   **Robotics Anonymous**: Robotics Anonymous is next tier up where you will be put into teams to build robots underneath a design manager. 
-   **Competition Team**: Our competition team will be largely focused on working on a rover similar to NASA's mars rover for competition in Spring in the University Rover Challenge.

**This coming meeting**, we will go over these details again and discuss the workshops and activities in depth. Towards the end, we will split into groups of interest so everyone can get specific information on the group they want. Sometime between this coming meeting and the meeting after, we will begin organizing our teams and groups.

*We are also looking for people who are interested in filling leadership positions. These positions need to be filled ASAP otherwise we will be unable to run the club this coming year! If you are interested in finding out more, attend the meeting and please contact us via facebook or e-mail if you are unable to make it.*

Hope to see you all tomorrow!
