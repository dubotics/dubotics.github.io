This post is an example of one that might be written by the 
arm team. The total sum of their posts can be viewed by 
navigating to the appropriate category.

<!--excerpt-->

I'm operating under the assumption that we have only a small,
relatively-constant set of fixed subteams:

-   Arm
-   Chassis
-   Control Systems
-   ...and perhaps Public Relations.

Each of these subteams gets their own category page. We also 
have a [general](/general) category page for any other posts
that need to be made.
