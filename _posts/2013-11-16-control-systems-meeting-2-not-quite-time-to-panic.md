Hello, everyone!

As we've done the previous two Saturdays, we'll be having the URC Control Systems meeting today at **3-4pm in MEB 238**.

I can't write much right now since I need to leave for campus in about ... zero minutes (tip: living on- or near campus is probably super-convenient -- but then, I wouldn't know), but today we'll be going over the basic configuration of our systems for the December deadline, and organize into small groups and work on the several goals:

-   Arm control implementation
-   Drive control implementation, and
-   Internal communications protocol data-structures definitions

<!--more-->

(though I feel like there's one other bullet point missing).  FYI I'm considering extending the meeting until 5 pm for those willing to stick around, because the arm team's meetings (which are two hours) feel so much more productive.

I'll see y'all at 3!
