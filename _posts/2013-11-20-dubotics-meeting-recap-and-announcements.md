Hello Everyone!

Here is a recap of last Thursday's General Meeting, as well as miscellaneous announcements for the club. Before you continue, I should warn you, there's a lot of information going on here.

-   **Workshops** have still not been started due to lack of funds. Currently, due to over 
    50% interest in the meeting, we are looking into offering an option for club members to 
    buy Arduino microprocessors and related components (estimated at $30 each due to bulk 
    discount) that you would use in the workshops, then be able to take home afterwards.
-   **Robotics Anonymous** is still brainstorming ideas for cool projects. One currently 
    popular idea is to repair Pieces of Eight, the club's first robot, which shoots tennis balls, 
    for both practice and demonstration use. If you are interested in anything Robotics Anonymous, 
    or have some great ideas, you can contact Tyler Williams at 
    <a href="mailto:tjwill@uw.edu">tjwill@uw.edu</a>.
-   **URC sub-team updates:**
    -   The **control team** has started organizing responsibilities and is waiting for delivery of
        parts. If you have any questions about the control team or are interested in helping, you 
        can contact Collin Sutton at 
        <a href="mailto:cjsutton@wahington.edu">cjsutton@wahington.edu</a> or Luis Naranjo at
        <a href="mailto:luisnaranjo733@gmail.com">luisnaranjo733@gmail.com</a>.
    -   The **chassis team** has all their major components except shock absorbers, and is working 
        on preparing metal pieces for construction. If the chassis fits your fancy, and you have    
        any questions or want to help, you can contact Robert Dyer at 
        <a href="mailto:robert4081@gmail.com">robert4081@gmail.com</a>.
    -   Last but not least, the **arm team** has hit some troubles attaining new parts, but has 
        already begun constructing a prototype out of scrap bits and pieces in the shop (we like to 
        call it recycling). If you have any questions concerning the arm team, or would like to 
        help, you can contact Christian Carpio at 
        <a href="mailto:cdcarpio@uw.edu">cdcarpio@uw.edu</a>.
-   We will be having **work sessions for URC** *Friday starting at 1:30 P.M.* with a focus on the 
    arm team, and again on *Saturday starting at 10:00 A.M.* with a focus on the chassis. 
    Everyone is welcome and shop certification is not needed (but definitely helpful)!
-   Preliminary details on our **trip to the URC competition in Hanksville, Utah** have begun to 
    show themselves! 
    -   The competition is three days, in addition to approximately 16 hours of driving each way, 
        for a total of five days. We would be leaving Wednesday, May 28, missing a total of three 
        days of school.
    -   As this is a school-sponsored event, so you would be able to get out of class excused and 
        get homework extensions, but there will be no internet in Hanksville to work on such things. 
    -   The logistics are planned to be completed by week four or five of next quarter (rooms, 
        transportation, etc.). Charges not covered by fundraising will need to be picked up by 
        those attending. Last year's cost was approximately $100 each for 7 people. We are looking 
        into a more permanent form of transportation as well, such as a club bus. 

If interested in going, please let us know by the first week of February.

-    **We are looking for a club photographer!** If you have the skills, and hopefully a DSLR 
    camera with short- and long-range lenses, we need you! Even if you aren't interested, we'd 
    still love your photos! Whether it's of meetings, work sessions, or anything else within 
    DUBotics, and the photos are of decent quality, we'll take it! If interested or if you have 
    photos, we will be distributing contact information shortly.
-   If you have yet to join the **Facebook group** (this is not the same as the Facebook page), you 
    can find it at <http://www.facebook.com/groups/dubotics>. It is a closed group, so there will be 
    a delay as we open the digital gates for you.
-   If you are still looking to get **shop certification** that doesn't conflict with classes (i.e. 
    on a Saturday), we expect to be able to do this around the beginning of second quarter, but no 
    sooner the dead week.
-   Finally, since our meetings are now bi-weekly, there will be **no meeting this week on 
    Thursday.** URC sub-team meetings will continue as normal.

If you survived through this entire post, I would like to congratulate you for making it to the very end.
