### Block quotes

> He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has 
> overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or 
> taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness... 
> Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing 
> right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it 
> disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, 
> lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes 
> made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper 
> lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single 
> twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running 
> off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.
>
