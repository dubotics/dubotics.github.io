<p>The chassis team is the team responsible for making a driving frame that all of the other subsystems can mount to.  We are in charge of integration of systems, as well as making sure all attached systems are as safe as possible from the outside world.</p>

<p>Our system is currently designed to travel at a maximum estimated speed of 15 mph (as compared to 2 last year), and can be dropped from the space needle and drive away like nothing happened, or so the numbers say.  We designed the system this way to allow our rover to adapt to the rugged terrain it will be facing.</p>

<p>The terrain consists of cliffs half a meter or taller, slopes in excess of 60 degrees, and loose rocky terrain.  Our design is capable of accomplishing these various terrains through a tank-tracked system.</p>
