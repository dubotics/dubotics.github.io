<h2 id="robotics-anonymous">Robotics Anonymous</h2>

<p><strong>Program manager:</strong> <a href="#">Tyler Williams</a></p>

<p>Robotics Anonymous is a group of club members who would rather experiment with robotics on their own time. We provide the necessary parts (Arduinos, breadboards, and other components) and the necessary tools (soldering irons, multimeters, etc) for anyone interested in exploring robotics and developing valuable skills in the process.</p>

<p>If you're interested in starting a project, please contact the program manager for more details.</p>
