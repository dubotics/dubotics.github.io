<h2 id="robotics-anonymous">Robotics Anonymous</h2>

<p><strong>Project Director:</strong> <a href="mailto:TJWill@uw.edu">Tyler Williams</a></p>

<p>Robotics Anonymous is a sub-section of DUBotics that focuses on non-competition-based projects, where members of the club will meet together to work on any tasks that we believe would be fun to give a go.  Robotics Anonymous provides materials and access to the tools and skilled individuals for the projects, and it's a great opportunity to make some awesome machines, meet like-minded people, and learn invaluable skills!</p>

<p>If you would like to join in, have any questions, or if you have project ideas of your own, don't hesitate to send an email to <a href="mailto:TJWill@uw.edu">TJWill@uw.edu</a></p>

<p>Meeting times and locations are TBD</p>

<p>Some potential projects under consideration are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Repairing "Pieces of Eight", our robot from last year</li>
    <li>Making a scrolling LED array</li>
    <li>Creating a Nerf Sentry Gun</li>
</ul>
