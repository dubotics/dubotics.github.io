    <p>Wells Fargo has become one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, serving one in three U.S. households and employing one in 500 working Americans. They have team members in more than 35 countries outside the U.S., serving 70 million customers in more than 130 countries around the world. In a cover story early in 2012, Forbes noted that Well's Fargo is “The Bank That Works.” The magazine also ranks them among the top 10 companies in the world based on a composite of sales, assets, profits and market value. Currently, they are now in the top 10 among all U.S. companies in profits and in the top 15 in U.S. market value.</p>

    <p>Well's Fargo has donated $1,000 to DUBotics through the Well's Fargo Fund, and this has been translated into parts for the electronics team.</p>
