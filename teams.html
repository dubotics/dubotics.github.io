<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>DUBotics is a multi-disciplinary engineering club from the University of Washington that focuses on the design, construction, and implementation of robots. Our mission is to provide team members valuable experience in multiple engineering disciplines, to teach others about robotics, and to win robotics competitions!</p>

<p>Due to the wide variety in skill level and needs of our members, our club provides three different programs that members can participate in. Members are free to participate in as many or as little programs as they wish. Please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> for more information or if you want to join a specific team.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="#workshops">Engineering Workshops</a></strong></p>
    
        <p>Engineering Workshops are taught by the more experienced member of the club, and are for beginners who want to expand their knowledge in areas such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>CAD and design</li>
            <li>Programming</li>

        <p><strong><a href="/teams/robotics-anonymous.html">Robotics Anonymous</a></strong></p>
        <p>Robotics Anonymous is a group of club members who would rather experiment with robotics on their own time. We provide the necessary parts (Arduinos, breadboards, and other components) and the necessary tools (soldering irons, multimeters, etc) for anyone interested in exploring robotics and developing valuable skills in the process.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong><a href="/teams/urc.html">University Rover Challenge Team</a></strong></p>
        
        <p>The University Rover Challenge Team (URC team) is a dedicated group of members with the task of creating a Mars Rover to compete in the international University Rover Challenge (URC). The team is separated into subteams that have work delegated to them by team leaders.</p>
