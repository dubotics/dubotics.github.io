<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>DUBotics is a multi-disciplinary engineering club from the University of Washington that focuses on the design, construction, and implementation of robots. Our mission is to provide team members valuable experience in multiple engineering disciplines, to teach others about robotics, and to win robotics competitions!</p>

<p>Due to the wide variety in skill level and needs of our members, our club is split into four different sections that members can participate in. Members are free to participate in as many or as little programs as they wish. Please <a href="{{ site.relative }}/contact.html">contact us</a> for more information or if you want to join a specific team.</p>

        <p>Engineering Workshops are taught by the more experienced member of the club, and are for beginners who want to expand their knowledge in areas such as:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>CAD and design</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Electronics</li>

        <p><strong><a href="{{ site.relative }}/teams/robotics-anonymous.html">Robotics Anonymous</a></strong></p>
        <p>Robotics Anonymous is a sub-section of DUBotics that focuses on non-competition-based projects, where members of the club will meet together to work on any tasks that we believe would be fun to give a go.  Robotics Anonymous provides materials and access to the tools and skilled individuals for the projects, and it's a great opportunity to make some awesome machines, meet like-minded people, and learn invaluable skills!</p>
