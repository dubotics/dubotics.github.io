<h2>About us</h2>

<p>We are <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a> students that form the 
robotics team. Each year we design and build robots for international competitions.</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>Our mission is to design and build robots to provide not only our team members 
with valuable experience in multiple engineering disciplines, but to create robots 
with advanced designs and win competitions.</p>

<p>Originally, our robotics club had competed in the collegiate 
<a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST robotics</a> competitions. As of fall of 2012, 
we have switched our focus to the 
<a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/">University Rover Challenge</a> 
where we must design a rover to perform missions under conditions simulating a space mission.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>DUBotics is a multi-disciplinary engineering group that draws students from the University
of Washington to participate in constructing robots for several international competitions. 
Most recently, the team has been participating in the University Rover Challenge and has to 
date competed in one year of the competition, submitting our first entry: The Cerberus Rover.</p>

<p>The team is divided into different subgroups that have work delegated to them by their 
individual group leaders, all of which are overseen by the team leaders. Currently, anyone 
regardless of major or intended major is open to join the team as most of the skills needed to 
participate can be learned on site.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The team generally meets in the Mechanical Engineering Annex. For more information on 
when specific teams meet and do, consult our <a href="{{ site.relative }}/teams.html">teams</a> page.</p>

<p>Most of our meetings take place in the Mechanical Engineering Annex, next to the 
Formula SAE team:</p>
